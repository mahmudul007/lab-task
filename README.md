## Project Overview

This application is a Facebook-style social feed where users can:

- Register and log in securely
- Create public or private posts with optional image uploads
- Like / unlike posts and comments
- Comment on posts and reply to comments (nested threads)
- View who liked a post, comment, or reply in a modal
- Load more comments on demand with a button, and scroll infinitely through posts and replies
- Delete their own comments using a conditionally visible delete button

## Backend Documentation

### Architecture

The backend follows a standard **Laravel MVC** pattern with a dedicated **API Resource** layer for consistent JSON responses.

### Database Schema

| Table                   | Key Columns                                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `users`                 | `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `password`               |
| `posts`                 | `id`, `created_by`, `text_content`, `is_private`                   |
| `post_images`           | `id`, `post_id`, `image_url`                                        |
| `post_likes`            | `id`, `post_id`, `user_id`                                          |
| `comments`              | `id`, `post_id`, `user_id`, `parent_comment_id`, `text_content`    |
| `comment_likes`         | `id`, `comment_id`, `user_id`                                       |
| `personal_access_tokens`| Laravel Sanctum token table                                         |

> **Replies** reuse the `comments` table via a self-referencing `parent_comment_id` foreign key. A top-level comment has `parent_comment_id = NULL`; a reply has it set to its parent comment's `id`.

### API Reference

All protected routes require the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

#### Auth

| Method | Endpoint          | Description             |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user  |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`    | Login and get token  |
| POST   | `/api/auth/logout`   | Revoke current token |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me`       | Get authenticated user |

#### Posts

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                               |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/posts?page=1`         | Paginated list of posts (public + own private) |
| POST   | `/api/posts`                | Create a post (supports image upload via multipart/form-data) |
| GET    | `/api/posts/{id}`           | Get single post                           |
| PUT    | `/api/posts/{id}`           | Update a post                             |
| DELETE | `/api/posts/{id}`           | Delete a post                             |
| GET    | `/api/posts/{id}/like`      | Toggle like on a post                     |
| GET    | `/api/posts/{id}/likers?page=1` | Paginated list of users who liked a post |

#### Comments & Replies

| Method | Endpoint                              | Description                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/posts/{postId}/comments?page=1` | Paginated comments for a post (each item includes `user_can_delete`) |
| POST   | `/api/posts/{postId}/comments`        | Add a comment to a post                 |
| DELETE | `/api/comments/{commentId}`           | Delete own comment (owner only)         |
| GET    | `/api/comments/{commentId}/replies?page=1` | Paginated replies for a comment    |
| POST   | `/api/comments/{commentId}/replies`   | Reply to a comment                      |
| POST   | `/api/comments/{commentId}/like`      | Toggle like on a comment or reply       |
| GET    | `/api/comments/{commentId}/likers?page=1` | Paginated list of users who liked a comment |

**All paginated endpoints** accept an optional `page` query parameter (defaults to page 1, 20 items per page). They return a standard Laravel paginator response shape:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "links": { "first": "...", "last": "...", "prev": null, "next": "..." },
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "last_page": 5,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

### Design Decisions (Backend)

1. **Laravel Sanctum for Authentication** — Token-based authentication was chosen because the frontend is a separate SPA. Sanctum issues plain-text Bearer tokens that are easy to store and send from Axios.

2. **API Resources instead of raw `toArray()`** — `PostResource`, `CommentResource`, and their Collection counterparts ensure a stable, versioned API contract. Computed fields like `is_liked_by_me`, `like_count`, and `reply_count` are resolved inside the resource using eager-loaded relationships, avoiding N+1 queries.

3. **Self-referencing Comments for Replies** — Rather than a separate `replies` table, replies are stored in the same `comments` table with a `parent_comment_id` foreign key. This keeps the schema simple and allows arbitrarily deep nesting in the future without schema changes.

4. **Visibility Guard (`checkPostVisibility`)** — A private helper on `CommentController` ensures that users cannot comment on or read comments of posts they are not allowed to see, enforcing data privacy rules consistently across all comment endpoints.

5. **Configurable `paginate` parameter** — Each list endpoint accepts a `paginate` query parameter to override the default page size, giving clients flexibility without requiring API versioning.

6. **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** — Comment and like tables use cascade deletes so that when a post or parent comment is deleted, all related child records (replies, likes) are automatically removed at the database level, keeping the database clean without extra application logic.

7. **`user_can_delete` authorization flag** — `CommentResource` includes `user_can_delete: (comment.user_id === auth()->id())` on every comment returned by the index endpoint. The frontend reads this boolean to conditionally render the Delete button, keeping ownership logic in one place on the server.

### Component Structure

#### Feed Section (`components/feed/`)

The `FeedMiddle` component is kept as a thin **orchestrator** — it simply renders the four feed section components in order. Each section is self-contained and independently responsible for its own data fetching.

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `DesktopStories` | Renders the horizontal story cards visible on desktop breakpoints |
| `MobileStories` | Renders the horizontal story scroll visible on mobile |
| `CreatePost` | Manages a controlled form with text + multi-image selection, submits via `useMutation`, clears on success |
| `FeedPosts` | Fetches posts with `useInfiniteQuery`, renders `PostCard` for each, and mounts `InfiniteScrollTrigger` at the bottom |
| `InfiniteScrollTrigger` | A reusable `div` that uses the native **`IntersectionObserver` API** to fire `fetchNextPage()` when it enters the viewport |

#### Post Interaction (`components/post/`)

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `PostCard` | Renders post header, body, images, reaction summary, and action buttons. Manages optimistic like state locally. Triggers `LikersModal` on the like-count badge. |
| `CommentSection` | Fetches comments with `useInfiniteQuery`, handles comment creation via `useMutation`. Shows a **Load more comments** button when more pages exist |
| `CommentItem` | Renders a single comment with like / reply actions. Shows **Delete** only when `comment.user_can_delete === true` |
| `ReplySection` | Fetches replies with `useInfiniteQuery`, handles reply creation via `useMutation` |
| `ReplyItem` | Renders a single reply. Manages optimistic reply-like state. Triggers `LikersModal` |
| `LikersModal` | A reusable modal that accepts `type: 'post' | 'comment'` and `id`, fetches likers via `useInfiniteQuery`, and supports infinite scroll within the modal itself |

### State Management

**Two layers of state coexist:**

1. **Zustand (`store.ts`)** — Handles global **authentication state** (`token`, `user`). Uses `persist` middleware to save to `localStorage` automatically. The `clearSession()` action resets both Zustand state and clears the persisted storage on logout.

2. **TanStack Query** — Handles all **server state** (posts, comments, replies, likers). Every mutation (`useMutation`) invalidates the relevant query keys on success, keeping the UI in sync with the server:
   - Creating a post → invalidates `['posts']`
   - Creating a comment → invalidates `['comments', postId]` and `['posts']`
   - Toggling a like → uses **optimistic updates** (state is updated immediately on `onMutate`, rolled back on `onError`, and reconciled with server truth on `onSuccess`)

### Design Decisions (Frontend)



1. **Optimistic Updates for Likes** — Like toggles update the UI instantly without waiting for the API response. If the request fails, the state is rolled back to its previous value. This removes perceived latency and makes the app feel fast even on slower connections.

2. **Modular `components/feed/` and `components/post/` directories** — Instead of one large `FeedMiddle.tsx` or `PostCard.tsx`, each concern is split into its own focused component. This makes individual pieces easy to test, maintain, and reason about in isolation.

3. **`LikersModal` is type-agnostic** — A single `LikersModal` component handles likers for posts, comments, and replies by accepting a `type` prop. This eliminates code duplication and keeps the UI consistent across all three contexts.

4. **Axios interceptors for token injection** — Rather than manually attaching the Bearer token in every API call, a request interceptor reads the current token from the Zustand store and attaches it to every outgoing request. A response interceptor catches 401 errors globally and redirects to `/login`, clearing the session.

5. **Component-level optimistic like state** — Post and comment like state is held in local `useState` (seeded from the API response) rather than in a global store or re-fetching the full list. This prevents the entire feed from re-rendering on every like toggle.

6. **`FeedMiddle` as orchestrator** — The `FeedMiddle` component contains no logic of its own. It simply composes `DesktopStories`, `MobileStories`, `CreatePost`, and `FeedPosts`. This makes it easy to add, remove, or reorder feed sections in one place.

7. **Manual "Load more" for comments** — The comment list uses an explicit **Load more comments** button instead of `IntersectionObserver`. Because comment threads live inside a post card, auto-triggering on viewport intersection fires prematurely as users scroll the feed; a button gives deliberate control.

8. **Server-authoritative delete visibility** — The Delete button in `CommentItem` renders only when `comment.user_can_delete` is `true`. This value is set by `CommentResource` (`user_id === Auth::id()`), so ownership logic lives entirely on the server and the frontend simply reflects it.
